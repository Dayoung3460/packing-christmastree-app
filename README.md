# 🎄 Christmas Tree Packing App


This project visualizes an optimisation algorithm that packs Christmas tree-shaped polygons into a bounding box without overlapping, aiming to minimize the total area.

## Background
This code was inspired by the AI Reasoning & Context Engineering Meetup held on Monday, December 1, 2025.

It is based on concepts shared by Andy Masters during his session on "Hierarchical Reasoning Models." The application demonstrates the reasoning and optimisation process of finding an optimal solution (minimum bounding box) under complex constraints (non-overlapping polygons).
